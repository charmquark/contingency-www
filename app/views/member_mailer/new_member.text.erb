Your account has just been created the Contingency community website. You may
get started using the site right now, at (<%= root_url %>).

Use the link in the footer to login. To help you become acquainted with the
current services offered by the site, there is a basic introductory manual
available at (<%= manual_url %>).

<%= @admin.handle %> created your account, so ask them for your password.

Once you are logged in, you can change your password to suit you by first going
