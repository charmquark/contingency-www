        <p>The Contingency is a community of friends united by a love of gaming and a general philosophy of curiosity, innovation, and hilarity. What began as a technical Minecraft server has expanded to encompass many kinds of experiences: survival games, shooters, minigames, building games, online board games, and more. Members often stream their activity at Twitch.tv and/or post videos to YouTube; and we love to interact with viewers. Depending on what's going on, we will sometimes invite viewers to tag along!</p>
